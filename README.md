This Web application is about Dice Game, it decides the winner based on the number rolled by the respective player.
This is my third mini Project. I built this game as a part of my ongoing Web Development Course on Udemy. I have learned about JavaScript and DOM , and applying my practical knowledge on functioning this Dice Game.
